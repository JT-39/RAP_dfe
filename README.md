# RAP DfE

This is a repository where I will store any RAP related work for the DfE that can be shared publicly.

I am currently working on a presentation in Quarto which gives a rapid (but hopefully engaging) overview of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines.

My interest and passion for the RAP really blossomed after reading Bruno Rodrigues' book "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R", available at this link: https://raps-with-r.dev/.
For anyone, at any stage, in their journey into RAP, this book is an absolute MUST.
