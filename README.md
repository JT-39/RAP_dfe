This is a repository where I will store any RAP related work for the DfE that can be shared publicly.

I am currently working on a presentation in Quarto which gives a rapid (but hopefully engaging) overview of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines.

My interest and passion for the RAP really blossomed after reading Bruno Rodrigues' book "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R", available [here](https://raps-with-r.dev/).
For anyone, at any stage, in their journey into RAP, this book is an absolute **MUST**.

Below is the link to the current published version of the slides:
